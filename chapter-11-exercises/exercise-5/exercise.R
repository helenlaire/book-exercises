# Exercise 5: dplyr grouped operations

# Install the `"nycflights13"` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
install.packages("nycflights13")  # should be done already
library("nycflights13")
library("dplyr")

View(flights)

# What was the average departure delay in each month?
dep_delay_by_month <- flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  #filter(is.na(dep_delay))

  summarize(
    delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
    
    #remoe all na values 
  )

  View(dep_delay_by_month)
# Save this as a data frame `dep_delay_by_month`
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarizing your data


# Which month had the greatest average departure delay?
dep_delay_by_month %>% 
  filter(delay == max(delay)) %>% 
  select(month)

# If your above data frame contains just two columns (e.g., "month", and "delay"
# in that order), you can create a scatterplot by passing that data frame to the
# `plot()` function
plot(dep_delay_by_month)


# To which destinations were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarize your data
# You can use the `head()` function to view just the first few rows


# You can look up these airports in the `airports` data frame!


# Which city was flown to with the highest average speed?
