# Exercise 2: working with data frames

# Create a vector of 100 employees ("Employee 1", "Employee 2", ... "Employee 100")
# Hint: use the `paste()` function and vector recycling to add a number to the word
# "Employee"

employee <- paste("Employee", 1:100)

# Create a vector of 100 random salaries for the year 2017
# Use the `runif()` function to pick random numbers between 40000 and 50000

salary_2017 <- runif(100,40000,50000)
salary_2017
# Create a vector of 100 annual salary adjustments between -5000 and 10000.
# (A negative number represents a salary decrease due to corporate greed)
# Again use the `runif()` function to pick 100 random numbers in that range.

salary_adjust <- runif(100, -5000, 10000)
# Create a data frame `salaries` by combining the 3 vectors you just made
# Remember to set `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`!

salaries <- data.frame(employee, salary_2017, salary_adjust, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
View(salaries)
# Add a column to the `salaries` data frame that represents each person's
# salary in 2018 (e.g., with the salary adjustment added in).
salaries$salary_2018 <- salaries$salary_2017+salaries$salary_adjust

View(salaries)
# Add a column to the `salaries` data frame that has a value of `TRUE` if the 
# person got a raise (their salary went up)

salaries$got_raise <- salaries$salary_adjust>0
View(salaries)
### Retrieve values from your data frame to answer the following questions
### Note that you should get the value as specific as possible (e.g., a single
### cell rather than the whole row!)

# What was the 2018 salary of Employee 57

salaries[57,"salary_2018"]
salaries$salary_2018[57]
# How many employees got a raise?
nrow(salaries[salaries$got_raise == TRUE,])


# What was the dollar value of the highest raise?
max(salaries$salary_adjust)
salaries[ salaries$salary_adjust == max(salaries$salary_adjust),]
# What was the "name" of the employee who received the highest raise?


# What was the largest decrease in salaries between the two years?


# What was the name of the employee who recieved largest decrease in salary?


# What was the average salary change?


# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose on average?


## Consider: do the above averages match what you expected them to be based on 
## how you generated the salaries?

# Write a .csv file of your salary data to your working directory
